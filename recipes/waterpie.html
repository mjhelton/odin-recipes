        <li>4 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup sugar</li>

        <li>Pour 1 + 1/2 cups water into the pie crust.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, stir together the flour and sugar. Sprinkle this mixture evenly over the water in the crust. Don't stir.</li>
        <li>Drizzle the vanilla over the water in the pie crust. Place pats of butter on top of this.</li>
